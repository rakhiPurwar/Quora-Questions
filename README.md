# Quora-Questions
- Non - negative Matrix factorisation is an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and clustering.
- We can use it in counjunction with tf-idf to model topics across documents.
- Our goal is to identify the number of topics and determine the theme of each topic. In addition, I tested whether my model can predict the topic theme given any new question.
- For this project we will be working with a dataset of over 400,000 quora questions that have no labeled cateogry, and attempting to find 20 cateogries to assign these questions to.
