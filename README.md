## What is Topic Modelling?
### Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique thatâ€™s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.
#### For this project we will be working with a dataset of over 400,000 Quora questions that have no labelled category, and attempting to find 20 categories to assign these questions to.
- Non - negative Matrix factorisation is an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and clustering.
- We can use it in counjunction with tf-idf to model topics across documents.
- Our goal is to identify the number of topics and determine the theme of each topic. In addition, I tested whether my model can predict the topic theme given any new question.
